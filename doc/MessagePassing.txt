This is an introduction on how to use the message passing part of the
Optimization Toolbox. Most of what you need to know you will learn from the
sample program in the directory mp_sample/. Make sure that you build the
directory common/ and the main directory before you build mp_sample/.

Here are some more details:
- when you add a factor, all participating variables must have been added
already. It is therefore advisable to add all variables before you start
adding factors.
- if you use a class that supports pairwise separators, you need to add the
two respective variables before you add the separator. Likewise, you need to
add a separator before you add any factors that use it.
- multiple calls to the respective optimization routines are
supported. However, you should not add any variables, separators or factors
in-between two such calls. 
- the classes with pair separators only support factors of order two, three
and four so far. It would however be possible to also support 1ofN,
cardinality and BILP potentials, as long as these do not use pair separators.
